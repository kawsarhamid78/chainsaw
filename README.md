# chainsaw
A plain blogger template, based on this blog post <a href='http://subinsb.com/make-a-blank-blogger-template'>Blank Template By subinsb.com</a>

Chainsaw is just a starting point template to get all of blogspot's gagets and pre-installed settings out of the way. This is only a blank starting point not a design.

## Requirements
The "Simple" template on blogger needs to be used before replacing the html.
If it is not, apply Simple Template to your blog.

## Steps
1. Copy the code from the chainsaw-blogger-template.xml file in this repository.
2. Go to the templates section in blogger.
3. Click edit html button.
4. Select all the code in the html section.
5. Paste the copied chainsaw-blogger-template.xml code in its place.
6. Save

**Note:** Paste the code in the edit html section instead of uploading the template to remove all of blogspots default gadgets.

You now have a blank blogger template to build on.

You can add static html or blogger gadgets to your site from here.

To learn more about how to build blogger gadgets into the template view their [official documentation](https://support.google.com/blogger).
